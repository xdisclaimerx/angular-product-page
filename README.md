# Angular4 User/Product Page

## products.json
Render the product table screens using this json file. The columnField array represents columns in a table. Parser must be ready to handle different setups for this.

## users.json
Render the users card screens using this json file. The columnField object represents a card. You can layout the users however you want inside the card. Renderer must be dynamic enough to handle changes to values of column field




Good luck, have fun!!
